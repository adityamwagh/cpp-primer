<h1 align="center">CPP Primer</h1>

## What is this?
A quick overview of the C++ programming language. This is an attempt to document/summarise the major concepts in C++ so that I can revisit it when needed.

## Why did I create this?
I primarily program in Python, and recently started graduate school in robotics. Most of the production code in robotics is written in C++, and Python is majorly used for prototyping ideas. Thus, it kind of mandatory for me to understand C++ well enough so that I can use it in a professional setting.

## What it is not!

It's not a documentation. You should refer to the https://en.cppreference.com/w/ for that. This would be something similar to this python [tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/).

## Contributions
If you find any errors, please feel free to make a pull request and correct it. It will help a fellow programmer, and I hope, others like me!
