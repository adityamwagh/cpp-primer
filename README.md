<h1 align="center" >CPP Primer<br></h1>

## What is this?
A quick overview of the C++ programming language. This is an attempt to document/summarise the major concepts in C++ so that anyone can revisit them when needed.

## What this is not!

This is not a documentation. The documentation lives [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/). It is something similar to this python [tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/).

## Why did I create this?
I primarily program in Python, and I recently started as a graduate student in robotics. Most of the production code in robotics is written in C++, and the prototyping is mostly done on python. So it's kind of mandatory for me to understand C++ well enough so that I can use it in a professional setting.

If you find any errors, please feel free to make a pull request and correct it. It will help a fellow programmer, and I hope, others like me!
