# CPP Primer

## What is this?
A quick overview of the C++ programming language. Consider this to be a documentation/summary for the things I have learnt about C++.

## Why did I create this?
I primarily program in Python, and recently started graduate school in robotics. Most of the production code in robotics is written in C++, and Python is majorly used for prototyping ideas. Thus, it kind of mandatory for me to understand C++ well enough so that I can use it in a professional setting.

## What it is not!

There are a lot of concepts in C++ which I don't understand as of now. 
It's not a documentation. You should refer to the https://en.cppreference.com/w/ for that. I am planning to make it similar to [cs231 python numpy tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/).

## Contributions
If you find any errors (I am a human, I make mistakes too.), please feel free to make a pull request and correct it. It will help a fellow programmer, and in future, I hope, others like me.
